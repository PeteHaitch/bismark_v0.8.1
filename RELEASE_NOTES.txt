RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.8.1 (16 Jul 2013)
-----------------------------------------------

Bismark
=======

Changed the way how the alignment overview file is being named to not generate a warning
message.


Methylation Extractor
=====================

Changed the function of '--ignore <int>' to ignore the first <int> bp from the 5' end of only
single-end reads or Read 1 of paired-end files. In addition, added a new option 
'--ignore_r2 <int>' to ignore the first <int> bp from the 5' end of Read 2 of paired-end files.
Since the first couple of bases in Read 2 of BS-Seq experiments show a severe bias towards
non-methylation as a result of the end-repair of sonicated fragments with unmethylated cytosines
(see M-bias plot), it is recommended that the the first couple of bp of Read 2 are removed before
starting downstream analysis. Please see the section on M-bias plots in the Bismark User Guide
for more details.

Changed colours, legends and background colour of the M-bias plot, but I think Simon 
is still not happy...





RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.8.0 (12 Jul 2013)
-----------------------------------------------

Bismark
=======

Added new option '--prefix <prefix>' to add <prefix> to the output filenames. Trailing
dots will be replaced by a single one. For example. '--prefix test' with 'file.fq'
would result in the output file 'test.file.fq_bismark.sam' etc.

Fixed a warning message that occurred when chromosomal sequences could not be extracted
in paired-end Bowtie2 mode.

Bismark will now generate a pie chart with the alignment statistics when a run has finished;
this allows to get a quick overview of how many sequences aligned uniquely, sequences that
did not align, either due to producing no alignment at all, multiple mapping or because it
was impossible to extract the chromosomal sequence. Drawing this plot will require the Perl
module GD::Graph; if it is not found on the system the plot will be skipped.


Methylation Extractor
=====================

Upon completion, the methylation extractor will now produce an M-bias (methylation bias)
plot, which shows the methylation proportion across each possible read position (described
in:  Hansen et al., Genome Biology, 2012, 13:R83). The data for the M-bias plot will be
written into a text file (to generate graphs by alternative means) and drawn into a .png
plot which  requires the Perl module GD::Graph; if GD::Graph cannot be found on the system,
only the table will be printed. The plot also contains the absolute number of methylation
calls per position.





RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.7.12 (10 May 2013)
-----------------------------------------------

Bismark
=======

Removed a rogue sleep(1) command that would slow down single-end Bowtie 2 alignments
for a single lane of HiSeq (200M sequences) from ~1 day to 6 years and 4 months (roughly).


bismark2bedGraph
================

bismark2bedGraph now keeps track of the temp files it just created instead of using
all files in the output folder ending in ".methXtractor.temp". This lets you kick off
the bedGraph conversion step from already sorted, individual methXtractor.temp files if
desired.




RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.7.11 (22 Apr 2013)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark
=======

Fixed non-functional single-end alignments with Bowtie2 which were accidentally broken
by introducing the option '--pbat' in v0.7.10 (an evil 'if' instead of 'elsif'...).

For paired-end alignments with Bowtie 1, the option '--non_bs_mm' would accidentally
confuse the number of mismatches of read 1 and read 2 whenever the first read aligned
in reverse orientation, i.e. for OB and CTOT alignments. This has now been corrected.
 
Previously, the option '--non_bs_mm' would potentially output non-integer values for
Bowtie 2 alignments if the read (or reference) contained 'N' characters. Alignment 
scores from 'N's are now adjusted so that they count as mismatches similar to what
Bowtie 1 does. This works for fine reads with up to and including 5 N's (which is quite
a lot...). 


Methylation Extractor
=====================

To avoid duplication and keep code modular, the bedGraph conversion step invoked by
the option '--bedGraph' is now been farmed out to the module 'bismark2bedGraph'. This
script is independent of the methylation extractor and also works as a stand-alone tool
from the methylation extractor output (compressed or gzip compressed files). To work
well from within the methylation extractor this script (which is now included in the
Bismark package) needs to reside in the same folder as the 'bismark_methylation_extractor'
itself.

bismark2bedGraph

Temporary chromosome files now have an input file name included in their file name to 
enable parallel processing of several files in the same directory at the same time.


To avoid duplication and keep code modular, the bedGraph to genome-wide cytosine methylation
report step invoked by the option '--cytosine_report' has now been split out to the
module 'bedGraph2cytosine'. This script is independent of the methylation extractor and
also works as a stand-alone tool from the Bismark bedGraph '--counts' output (compressed
or gzip compressed files). To work well from within the methylation extractor this 
script (which is now included in the Bismark package) needs to reside in the same folder
as the 'bismark_methylation_extractor' itself.


Deduplication script
====================

Fixed some warnings that were thrown if '--bam' was not specified.



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.7.10 (18 Apr 2013)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark
=======

Added new option '--gzip' that causes temporary bisulfite conversion files to be
written out in a GZIP compressed form in order to save disk space. This option is
available for most alignment modes but is not available for paired-end FastA files 
(not many people use PE FastA files...). This option might be somewhat slower than
writing out uncompressed files, but this awaits further testing.

Added new option '--bam' that causes the output file to be written out in BAM format
instead of the default SAM format. Bismark will attempt to use the path to Samtools
that was specified with '--samtools_path', or, if it hasn't been specified explicitly,
attempt to find Samtools in the PATH. If no installation of Samtools can be found
the SAM output will be compressed with GZIP instead (yielding a .sam.gz output file).

Added new option '--samtools_path' to point Bismark to your Samtools installation, e.g.
/home/user/samtools/. Does not need to be specified explicitly if Samtools is in the
PATH.

Added new option '--pbat' which may be used for PBAT-Seq libraries (Post-Bisulfite
Adapter Tagging; Kobayashi et al., PLoS Genetics, 2012). This is essentially the exact
opposite of alignments in 'directional' mode, as it will only launch two alignment
threads to the CTOT and CTOB strands instead of the normal OT and OB ones. The option
--pbat works only for single-end and paired-end FastQ files for use with Bowtie1 (and 
uncompressed temporary files only).


Methylation Extractor
=====================

The methylation extractor does now also read BAM files, however this requires a working
copy of Samtools. For this we added the new option '--samtools_path' to point the Bismark
methylation extractor to your Samtools installation, e.g. /home/user/samtools/. This does
not need to be specified explicitly if Samtools is in the PATH.

Added new option '--gzip' to write out the primary methylation extractor files (CpG_OT_...,
CpG_OB_... etc) in a GZIP compressed form to save disk space. This option does not work
on bedGraph and genome-wide cytosine reports as they are 'tiny' anyway.

The methylation extractor does now treat InDel free reads differently than before which
results in a ~60% increase in extraction speed for ungapped alignments in SAM format!


Deduplication script
====================

The deduplication script does now also read BAM files, however this requires a working
copy of Samtools. The new option '--samtools_path' may point the script to your Samtools
installation, e.g. /home/user/samtools/. This does not need to be specified explicitly
if Samtools is in the PATH.

The deduplication script also received the new option '--bam' to write out deduplicated
files directly in BAM format. If no installation of Samtools can be found the SAM output
will be compressed with GZIP instead (yielding a .sam.gz output file).




RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.7.9 (05 Mar 2013)
----------------------------------------------

Methylation Extractor
=====================

The new function '--buffer_size <string>' for the bedGraph sort command is set to the
new default value of 2G (sort would die if this option was not set).

The replacement of pipe ('|') characters in the name of reference chromosomes for the 
bedGraph sorting step should now work as expected. 

If multiple files are to be processed for genome-wide methylation reports in a single
command, the reference genome is only read in once (instead of stopping due to the
presence of several chromosomes with the same name...).




RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.7.8 (01 Mar 2013)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark
=======

Added an option '--non_bs_mm' which prints an extra column at the end of SAM files
showing the number of non-nisulfite mismatches of a read. This option is not available
for '--vanilla' format.

Format for single-end reads: "XA:Z:mismatches"

Format for paired-end reads: read 1: "XA:Z:mismatches"
                             read 2: "XB:Z:mismatches"

If Bowtie 2 was used for alignments, the alignment score and CIGAR strings are processed
to exclude potential insertions or deletions before the number of non-bisulfite mismatches
is determined.


The mapping report file names were changed to _bismark_(SE/PE)_report.txt (Bowtie 1) or 
bt2_bismark_(SE/PE)_report.txt (Bowtie 2) to keep it more uniform.



Methylation Extractor
=====================

The input file(s) may now be specified with a file path which abrogates the need to be in
the same directory as the input file(s) when calling the methylation extractor.

Reference sequence files containing pipe ('|') characters were found to crash the methylation
extractor as the chromosome name was used for filenames. These characters are now replaced
with underscores '_' when the reads are sorted during the bedGraph step.

Added a new funtion '--buffer_size <string>' for the bedGraph sort command to allow using
more memory than the default (1024K). Allowed values are either a percentage of physical
memory (e.g. 50%) or a number along with a multiplier in bytes (e.g. 500M, 50G etc).



Updated the Bismark User Guide with sections for the bedGraph and genome-wide methylation
report outputs and Appendix IV is now showing alignment stats for the test data.




RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.7.7 (02 Oct 2012)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark
=======

When reading in the genome file Bismark does now automatically remove \r line ending
characters as well. This sometimes caused problems when genome files had been edited
on Windows machines.

Added support for the Bowtie 2 options '--rdg <int1>,<int2>' and '--rfg <int1>,<int2>'
to adjust the gap open and extension penalties for both read and reference sequence.
This might be useful for very special conditions (e.g. PacBio data...)


Bismark methylation extractor
=============================

Added new function '-o/--output' to specify an output directory. This became necessary for
better integration into Galaxy.

Added new function '--no_header' to suppress the Bismark version header in the output files
if plain alignment data is more desirable.  

Renamed methylation extractor to bismark_methylation_extractor.


bedGraph output:
----------------

Added option '--bedGraph' to produce a bedGraph output file once the methylation extraction
has finished; this reports the genomic location of a cytosine and its methylation state (in %).
This basically implements the finctionality of the script:
genome_methylation_bismark2bedGraph.pl directly into the mbismark_methylation_extractor.
The bedGraph output file is sorted by chromosomal positions. By default, only cytosines in
CpG context will be sorted. The option '--CX_context' may be used to report all cyosines
irrespective of sequence context (however this will take MUCH longer!).

Implemented option '--cutoff threshold' to set the minimum number of times a methylation state
has to be seen for that nucleotide before its methylation percentage is reported.

Implemented option '--counts' which adds two additional columns to the bedGraph output file
to enable further calculations:
 
                     col 5: number of methylated calls
                     col 6: number of unmethylated calls

Implemented option '--CX_context' so that the sorted bedGraph output file contains information
on every single cytosine that was covered in the experiment irrespective of its sequence context.


Genome-wide cytosine methylation report output:
-----------------------------------------------

Added option '--cytosine_report' which produces a genome-wide methylation report for all cytosines
in the genome. By default, the output uses 1-based chromosome coordinates (zero-based cords are
optional) and reports CpG context only (all cytosine context is optional). The output considers
all Cs on both forward and reverse strands and reports their position, strand, trinucleotide
content and methylation state (counts are 0 if not covered).

Option '--CX_context' applies to the cytosine report as well. The output file wil contain information
on every single cytosine in the genome irrespective of its context. This applies to both forward
and reverse strands.

Implemented option '--zero_based' to use zero-based coordinates like used in e.g. bed files
instead of 1-based coordinates.

Implemented option '--genome_folder <FULL PATH>' to be used to extract sequences from. Accepted
formats are FastA files ending with '.fa' or '.fasta'.

Added an option '--split_by_chromosome' which writes the cytosine report output to individual
chromosome files instead of to one single large file.




UPDATE for genome_methylation2bedGraph script (23 Aug 2012)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Added an option '--split_by_chromosome' to enable sorting of very large files. The methylation
extractor output is first written into temporary files chromosome by chromosome. These
files are then sorted by position and deleted afterwards.

Added an option '--counts' which adds 2 more lines to the bedGraph output file:

      Column 5: count of methylated calls per position, and
      Column 6: count of unmethylated calls per position. 

Technically, this renders the output to be no longer in bedGraph format, but it might enable
additional calculations with the output.



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.7.6 (31 Jul 2012)
----------------------------------------------

Methylation extractor

Changed the way in which the methylation extractor identifies the read and genome
conversion flags in SAM output. This might become relevant if the Bismark SAM mapping output
was compressed/decompressed with CRAM or Goby at some point, since these tools may change
the order of the tags in a SAM entry. Thanks to Zachary Zeno for pointing this out and
contributing a patch.

Reworked the way in which SAM files (both single and paired-end) are handled in the
methylation extractor so that reads containing InDels, which may be generated by Bismark 
using Bowtie 2, are now handled as intended. Insertions or deletion resulted in small
positional shifts of methylation calls.



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.7.5 (16 Jul 2012)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark

Trailing read ID segment number (e.g. /1,/2 or /3) are now removed internally for Bowtie 2
alignments in paired-end mode as this might have caused no reads to align at all if the
segment number was not 1 or 2. As of Bowtie 2 version 2.0.0-beta7 this behavior has been
disabled for unpaired reads.

The Bowtie 2 option -M is now deprecated (as of Bowtie 2 version 2.0.0-beta7). What used
to be called -M mode is still the default mode, but adjusting the -M setting is deprecated.
The options -D and -R should be used to adjust the effort expended to find valid alignments.
The help text for the -M mode is still being displayed but may be removed in a subsequent
release.

Changed the default seed mismatch parameter (controlled by -n) to 1 (down from 2). This
increases alignment speed noticably and typically produces very similar results for good
quality read data. 

Fixed a bug where the chromosomal sequence could not be extracted for very short genomic
sequences for alignments with Bowtie 2.	


Methylation extractor

Does now read both raw and gzipped (.gz) Bismark mapping files.


Deduplication script

Does now read both raw and gzipped (.gz) Bismark mapping files.



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.7.4 (26 Apr 2012)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark

Introduced a new option '--temp <dir>' to which the C-to-T or G-to-A transcribed temporary
files can be written to instead of into the same folder that contains the input files. If the
specified folder does not exist Bismark will try to create it first.

The input files to be aligned may now contain path information, e.g. /home/user/file.fq or 
../temp/file.fq, and one no longer has to call Bismark from within the directory containing
the input files. 




RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.7.3 (05 Apr 2012)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark

Corrected a bug for the TLEN field in paired-end SAM output. This value was occasionally 
calculated incorrectly if both reads were overlapping almost entirely with a difference 
of only 1 bp between the end of one read and the start of the second read.

Removed a potential source of crashes with gzipped input files and the option -u/--qupto.


Methylation Extractor

Corrected a potential flaw for the 'remove overlap' option for paired-end alignments in --vanilla
mode when the first read aligned in a reverse orientation. Everything is now working as intended.

Output files will now only have a single .txt file extension if the Bismark results file was
already ending in .txt.



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.7.2 (14 Mar 2012)
----------------------------------------------

methylation_extractor

Changed the file ending for all files generated by the methylation extractor to .txt. This is
to avoid confusing these files with SAM formatted Bismark output files.




RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.7.1 (29 Feb 2012)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark

Adjusted Bismark so that white spaces or tab characters in the read IDs get replaced on the fly
with underscore characters. This step is necessary because some read ID checks would cause Bismark
to fail. In particular, Bowtie2 truncates read IDs if it encounters white space characters in the
read ID (probably consistent with the notion that everything after the first word in the read ID
is an optional description). Since IDs generated by the latest version of the Illumina RTA always
contain spaces, these input files would not work. In contrast, Bowtie 1 doesn't mind 'simple space'
characters but truncates read IDs if a 'tab' characters was encountered. As a solution that does
not truncate all read IDs to the word before the first white space (e.g. the example on the FastQ
article on Wikipedia:

@SRR001666.1 071112_SLXA-EAS1_s_7:5:1:817:345 length=36 

would have every single read ID truncated to:

SRR001666.1

which I don't find particularly helpful), we decided to replace all white spaces with underscores.
This should work equally well for both Bowtie 1 and Bowtie 2.


RRBS User Guide and trim_galore

This package contains a brief guide to quality control aspects of RRBS experiments (some of
which are also relevant for standard shotgun libraries). It also contains the trim_galore script
which wraps around Cutadapt to perform quality and/or adapter trimming as well as some
trimming steps to remove cytosines with an experimentally introduced methylation state (this is 
specific to RRBS-type experiments). Also included is a validate_paired_end_script that reads in
two paired-end files at the same time and removes read pairs for which one (or both) reads are
shorter than a certain length (25bp by default).



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.7.0 (24 Feb 2012)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark

As a result of several requests we changed Bismark's behavior for "--directional" mode
(which is on by default) to run only 2 parallel instances of Bowtie 1/2 to the original top
(OT) and bottom (OB) strands, instead of 4 to all possible bisulfite strands. This change
might result in faster alignment times (because reads from directional libraries don't
typically align very well to the complementary strands) and possibly a somewhat increased
mapping efficiency for directional libraries (because less reads get booted due to ambiguous
mapping to the theoretical complementary strands).

It is still possible to run the 4-alignment strand mode for any combination of input file(s)
and choice of aligner by specifying --non_directional. If one wants to get an idea of the
number of mismapping events one could run Bismark in --non_directional mode, look at the
number of alignments to the CTOT or CTOB strands and then ignore the output to these 
complementary strands via the methylation extractor.


Changed the --score_min default function for Bowtie 2 alignments to a more stringent setting of
"L,0,-0.2" instead of using the Bowtie2 default function (which was "L,0,-0.6"). Thanks to E.
Harris for this suggestion.




RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.6.4 (06 Feb 2012)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark

For paired-end mode, the options --unmapped and --ambiguous do now output unaligned or 
multiply aligned reads, respectively, to their correct output files as intended.
 
Adjusted the options -u and -s so that only the non-skipped part of the input file will
be transcribed and analysed. This allows splitting up very large files into smaller chunks to 
allow parallel processing, e.g -s 10000000 -u 20000000 would analyse sequences 10000001 to
20000000. The alignment report will be based on this reduced number of reads analysed.

Sequences in FastA format do now receive Phred score qualities of 40 throughout (ASCII 'I') 
to prevent the SAM to BAM conversion in SAMtools from failing.

If a genomic sequence could not be extracted it will now also be counted and reported for
use with Bowtie 1.

Suppressed debugging warning meassages that were printed in error for Bowtie2 alignments
(single-end only).



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.6.3 (04 Jan 2012)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark

Changed the XX:Z mismatch field in the SAM output to display mismatching nucleotides
in the reference sequence (instead of in the read sequence).

Fixed a bug that occured when a read was called '0'.


Methylation Extractor

The methylation extractor does now also accept Bismark output files in SAM format. Please
type "methylation_extractor --help" or refer to the Bismark User Guide for more information.



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.6.beta2 (15 Dec 2011)
--------------------------------------------------

Bismark

Added a paralleliztion option for Bowtie 2 alignments with the option '-p'. Please note that
this is only recommended if your system resources are plentyful. Please bear in mind that
specifying for instance '-p 2' will already use 8 threads/cores for Bowtie2 plus 1 additional
core for Bismark itself, and thereby consume more than 15GB of memory!

This parallelization switch in Bismark also uses the Bowtie 2 option '--reorder', and thus 
requires at least Bowtie 2 version 2.0.0-beta5 or higher (released on Dec 15, 2011).

   



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.6.beta1 (08 Dec 2011)
-------------------------------------------------

Bismark_genome_preparation

Added option '--bowtie2' to create Bowtie 2 indexes. Please note that Bowtie 1 and Bowtie 2
indexes are not compatible. Bowtie 2 indexes can be safely written into the same folder
already containing the Bowtie 1 indexes.


Bismark

Please make sure that BS-Seq data is checked for adapter contamination and/or poor quality
base calls and appropriately trimmed before alignments are carried out. 

Bowtie 1 mode (default)

- Changed the default output format to SAM. Unaligned reads or ambiguous alignments are not
reported into the output file. These can be written out to _unaligned_read or _ambiguous_read
files in FastQ format if desired as usual. The 'old' Bismark output can still be obtained by
specifying '--vanilla'.

- Alignments are now in the former '--directional' mode by default, i.e. only alignments to
the original top (OT) and original bottom (OB) strand will be reported. The full 4-strand
output for non-directional libraries can be re-enabled by specifying '--non_directional'.

- Alignments are now run with the Bowtie parameters '--norc' or '--nofw' where appropriate.
This may result in a slightly increased mapping efficiency as less reads are removed due to
non-sensical alignments.

- The default value for paired-end maximum insert size (-X/--maxins) was increased to 500bp
(up from 250bp).


Bowtie 2 mode (optional by specifying '--bowtie2')

- The options used for running Bowtie 2 are still to be considered experimental until we
manage to figure out the most sensible way. Currently, these parameters are freely adjustable:

-M <int>           (reporting the best out of <int> valid alignments)
-N <int>           (multi-seed mismatches)
-L <int>           (seed length)
-D <int>           (maximum number of seed extension fail tries)
-R <int>           (reseeding of repetitive alignments)
--score-min <func> (setting minimum alignment score for valid alignments) 

For correct and reliable methylation calls it is essential that bisulfite reads are aligned
correctly without tolerating too many mismatches. Therefore, when using Bowtie 2 the option
'--ignore-quals' is always on, meaning that a mismatch between the read and the genome will
always receive a penalty of '6', and this penalty is not reduced by a low basecall quality.
As mentioned above, poor quality data should be quality-trimmed before carrying out sequence
alignments.

- Paired-end alignments in Bowtie 2 are carried out using the options '--no-mixed' and 
'--no-discordant'. This means that Bowtie 2 only looks for concordant paired-end alignments
and does not automatically look for discordant alignments or single-end alignments in case it
can't find any concordant paired-end alignments. The latter might change in a future release. 


Relevant for both modes

- added option '--no_sam_header', so that output files start with alignments straight away.
This might be useful when large input files are split up into several smaller files and the
output files are to be merged.



bismark2SAM.pl

The bismark2SAM conversion script (version 6) does now reverse the quality and methylation
call strings if a sequence was reverse complemented for SAM output.



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.5.4 (17 Oct 2011)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark

Bismark will now accept input files in either normal, uncompressed or gzipped format 
(files have to ending in .gz).

Added the option -o/--output_dir <dir> to Bismark which lets you specify the folder
for all Bismark output files instead of writing into the same folder as the input file(s).
If the output directory does not exist already it will be created.

The path to the genome folder can now be absolute or relative (e.g. ../genomes/mouse/).

Changed the way unmapped or ambiguous reads are reported so that one output file (and/or
ambiguous read file) is generated per input file. Their name will be derived from the
input file name. For paired-end samples, the unmapped or ambiguous filenames can be
discriminated by _1 and _2 in their file names.

Added the number of sequences analysed in total to the paired-end report file (was only
printed on screen previously).

Fixed a bug for the FastQ output for ambiguous reads where quality scores were not followed
by a new line.




RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.5.3 (13 Sep 2011)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark

The '--chunkmbs' default parameter was increased to 512 MB (up from 256 MB) to avoid
memory exhaustion warnings.

Corrected a mix-up of the strand origin names in the printed final alignment report:
GA/CT is now correctly labelled as CTOT (complementary to (converted) top strand), and 
GA/GA is now correctly labelled as CTOB (complementary to (converted) bottom strand).


genome_methylation_bismark2bedGraph_v3.pl

This new version fixes a bug in the methylation percentage which was introduced by
implementing 0-based (bedGraph) coordinates. Many thanks to Michael A. Bentley for
spotting this issue and for contributing this new version.


bismark2SAM_v5.pl

This new version of the bismark2SAM conversion script introduces adjusted bitwise FLAG
values for non-directional single-end and for paired-end alignments. This is to better
reflect the strand origin of a read or a read pair. E.g., alignments to the OT strand
are always found in '+' orientation, whereas alignments to the CTOT strand are always found
in a '-' orientation. Both these alignments will now get a FLAG value of '0' indicating that
the read originated from the original top strand. A similar logic is also applied for
alignments to other strands and for paired-end alignments. Thanks to Enrique Vidal for
bringing this to my attention and for his contributions to this new version.



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.5.2 (16 Aug 2011)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark

The '--chunkmbs' default parameter was increased to 256 MB (up from 64 MB) to avoid
memory exhaustion warnings.

Bismark will now accept single-end file names in both comma- and space-separated
format.

Sequence files with sequence ID names containing tab stops are truncated by Bowtie
to the first element, which results in no sequence alignments. Bismark will detect
whether the seqID field contains tab characters and print a warning at the end of
the run (also into the log file). Simply replacing tabs with whitespaces in the
seqID lines of the input file fixes this problem (e.g. with $id =~ s/\t/ /g; ), 
however this needs to be handled before invoking Bismark.


Methylation Extractor

Fixed a bug which resulted in offset methylation positions (by the read length)
for single-end reverse strand alignments when the option '--ignore' was specified.




RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.5.1 (16 June 2011)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark_genome_preparation:

The genome folder can now be specified either as absolute or relative path.


Bismark

Fixed a bug where a newline character was missing after the quality value in
the FastQ unmapped read output.

Fixed a bug which prevented paired-end read alignments in FastA format.


Methylation Extractor

The input file(s) can now also be specified with a relative path. The output
files will be written into the current working directory.



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.5.0 (21 Apr 2011)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark

Due to upcoming changes in the Illumina Casava 1.8 pipeline the FastQ output format
for paired-end files will look different to earlier versions. If run in paired-end 
mode, Bismark is now always appending /1 to all reads from the file specified by -1,
/2 to all reads from the file specified by -2 while the sequences are converted into
bisulfite sequences. This should ensure that pretty much any format will be aligned
correctly.

The Bismark single-end mapping output will now have an additional column at the end
showing the basecall quality scores of the FastQ file to allow for quality filtering.
The field is left blank for FastA input.

The Bismark paired-end mapping output will now have two additional columns at the end
showing the basecall quality scores of the FastQ files for read 1 and read 2 to allow
for quality filtering. Both fields are left blank for FastA input.

Fixed a bug for paired-end alignments whereby alignments to the CTOT strand were 
incorrectly assigned to the CTOB strand and vice versa.


Methylation Extractor 

Fixed a bug for paired-end alignments whereby alignments to the CTOT strand were
incorrectly assigned to the CTOB strand and vice versa.




RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.4.1 (10 Feb 2011)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark_genome_preparation:

The Bismark genome preparation will now write both bisulfite converted versions
of the genome to one multi-FastA file (MFA) file per genome by default. This allows
indexing of newly assembled genomes with several thousands of chromosomes (and/or
contigs or scaffolds). Trying to index genomes with 20,000-50,000 chromosomes
previously exceeded the operating system limit of concatenting chromosome names into
a list. Chromosomes can still be converted and written out individually by selecting
the option --single. 

Bismark

Changed the way paired-end alignments are reported internally slightly. This means
that sequences which produce two alignments to the exact same position in different
alignment processes will now be preferentially assigned to the original top (OT)
and orginal bottom (OB) strands, as intended. Previously, alignments were prefer-
entially assigned to the CTOB strand before the OB strand. This was only relevant for
alignments for which sequences did either not contain a single C or G, or if sequences
showed a 100% protection, i.e. methylation, of all Cs and if --directional was selected.



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.4.0 (04 Feb 2011)
----------------------------------------------

The option '--directional' is now also working for paired-end alignments. If 
the BS-Seq library was generated in a strand-specific way (i.e. only the
(bisuflite converted versions) of the top and bottom strand are being sequenced),
best alignments to the strands complementary to either the original top or bottom
strands will be ignored. It is recommended to use this option for directional
paired-end libraries.

Fixed a strand-identity mix-up which was printed in the mapping summary report
of paired-end alignmnents (this only concerned the report itself, alignments as
such or the output of the methylation extractor were not affected).



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.3.0 (26 Jan 2011)
----------------------------------------------

The Bismark documentation received a complete overhaul. The Bismark User Guide
replaces the previous documentation (INSTALL.txt and README.txt). It contains
a Quick reference to get started quickly witout having to read the entire User
Guide. In addition to that it also contains detailed information about BS-Seq
in general, about how Bismark works, its output formats and discusses some of the
available options. The Appendix section does now include all available options
of all three scripts of the Bismark package (bismark_genome_preparation, bismark
and methylation_extractor).

We do now offer a BS-Seq test data set for download so that users can try Bismark
out. The test data set consists of 10,000 sequences taken from a human shotgun 
BS-Seq dataset (SRR020138, Lister et al. 2009). The sequences have been trimmed
to 50 bp and its base call qualities are Phred33 encoded.

Both the bismark_genome_preparation and bismark itself will now accept reference
genome sequence files (in FastA format) with the file extension .fasta in addition
to .fa.



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.2.6 (18 Jan 2011)
----------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug which might occur if the alignment parameters are set very laxly.
This only affected alignments if 10 or more non-bisulfite mismatches are 
tolerated (Please note that we would absolutely not recommend allowing that
many mismatches for BS-Seq!!).
 


RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.2.5 (22 Dec 2010)
----------------------------------------------

Added the new option --un <filename> to Bismark which will write out all 
reads failing to align uniquely to <filename> in the same format they were 
provided (FastQ or FastA). This will inlcude both reads that do not
produce any alignments and reads which are being rejected due to ambiguous
mapping unless --ambiguous <filename> has been specified as well (see below).

Added the new option --ambiguous <filename> to Bismark which will write out
all reads that are being rejected due to ambiguous mapping. Reads which are
reported by --ambiguous will not appear in the output of --un <filename>.



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.2.4 (18 Nov 2010)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark

Added the new options -I/--minins <int> and -X/--maxins <int> to Bismark to
allow the specification of minimum and maximum insert sizes for paired-end
alignments.


Bismark_genome_preparation

Changed the remove_tree command in the File::Path core module rm_tree in the
same module instead, as some older versions of Perl would throw an error
otherwise.



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.2.3 (04 Nov 2010)
----------------------------------------------

Added the new option --directional to Bismark. If the BS-Seq library was
constructed in a strand-specific way one would expect to see only sequences
corresponding to the (C -> T converted) original top or bottom strands. The
two strands which are complementary to the original strands are - in this case
- only theoretical and should not be observable in the sequencing experiment.
Specifying --directional will reject alignments to these in silico existing 
strands and will generate a small report about rejected sequences after the
Bismark run has been completed.     

Changed the default alignment option of Bismark to --best to ensure the most 
credible alignment results. This can be turned off by specifying --no_best.
Disabling --best can speed up the alignment process (good for testing purposes),
but this will increase the risk of mismappings at the same time. 

Added the option -e/--maqerr <int> so that one can play around with the maximum 
number of tolerated mismatches if this is desired/required at some point.  

The output files generated by Bismark will now end in '_bismark.txt' for single-
end files or '_bismark_pe.txt' for paired-end files. The mapping and splitting
reports will also end in .txt. 

The alignment and methylation summary reports have been slightly modified to 
allow better readability.



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.2.2 (13 Sep 2010)
----------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug in the methylation extactor that would offset a subset of
reverse mapped reads by a couple of bases. Positions should now be correct.



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.2.1 (08 Sep 2010)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark will now handle multi-fasta-files as intended.



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.2.0 (07 Sep 2010)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark

Non-CpG context is now subdivided into cytosines in CHG and CHH context,
whereby H can be either A, T or C. This change also means that the genomic 
sequence a bisulfite read is compared against must be 2 bp longer than the 
actual read itself; this genomic sequence is also reported in the Bismark 
mapping results file. Cytosines in non-CpG context received the following
new characters in the methylation call string to avoid confusion with older
Bismark files:

CHG-context: X / x (methylated / unmethylated)
CHH-context: H / h (methylated / unmethylated)
 
 
Due to recent changes in the Bowtie source code, Bismark produced lots 
of warnings ('chunk memory exhausted...'). To counteract this problem 
Bismark will now understand the additional option '--chunkmbs <int>' (to 
increase the memory allocation for individual alignments from 64 (default)
to any integer). These errors were especially frequent in --best mode or for 
paired-end alignments. Bismark will also understand the '--quiet' option
to suppress memory chunk exhaustion (and other) warnings.  

FastA files do no longer require the file ending ".fa".

Fixed an issues so that Bismark will no longer tolerate chromosomes with
same name when reading the genome into memory.  


Methylation Extractor

The methylation extractor will by default distinguish between cytosines in
the three contexts CpG, CHG or CHH. If this is not needed, CHG and CHH context 
can be merged into 'non-CpG' context by specifying '--merge_non_CpG'.

Due to the fundamental changes in v0.2.0 (CHG and CHH context methylation 
calls) the methylation extractor will require that the Bismark mapping result
file was generated with the same Bismark version (the Bismark version is
contained within the first line of the mapping result file).



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.1.5 (09 Aug 2010)
----------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug where specifying "-n 0" as alignment parameter would not 
be executed properly.



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.1.4 (06 Aug 2010)
----------------------------------------------

The Bismark alignment process would previously grind to a halt when it
encountered DNA ambiguity bases in the reference genome sequence (R,M...)
while trying to determine the sequence context of (un-)methylated Cs.
This behaviour has now been changed so that everything else than a C in
CpG context was will now be treated as C in not-CpG context.

Fixed a bug whereby the single-end strand-specific output got two of 
the four possible strands mixed up (fixed properly this time).  



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.1.3 (03 Aug 2010)
----------------------------------------------

Bismark Genome Preparation

If the specified genome directory does already contain a bisulfite 
genome folder, all contents of this directory will be removed before
creating and indexing a new bisulfite genome. Make sure that this
directory does not contain any other data. 

The genome indexer will now convert DNA ambiguity code into N's before 
making the bisulfite genomes (anything else than C, A, T or G will appear
as N afterwards). 

The indexer will now also handle fastA files with mutltiple sequence 
entries in addition to (a list of) fastA files in the specified genome
folder. (Please note that bowtie-build only accepts a few hundred 
individual files (or 'chromosomes') for indexing. If you want to index
more sequences than that they need to be merged in some way).  

Methylation Extractor

Fixed a bug whereby the single-end strand-specific output got two of 
the four possible strands mixed up. Also, the --ignore <int> option did 
previously offset some of the positions of the methylation calls by the 
<int> specified. Both options should now work as intended.

For paired-end alignments with rather short fragment lengths it is 
theoretically possible to read stretches of overlapping sequence with 
both read 1 and read 2. In order not to score the methylation calls for
overlapping sequences twice, we added an option (--no_overlap) to score
overlapping methylation calls only from the first read of a given alignment.

It is a somewhat icky decision to not use the full information of both 
reads, as on the one hand it is good to get as much methylation call 
information as possible, on the other hand cytosines in the middle of
paired-end fragments might get considerably more methylation calls than 
more distal ones. Please note that we are at this stage not comparing or 
evaluating the methylation calls from both reads (even though this is 
entirely possible) but rather just use the calls from one read.  



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.1.2 (17 Jun 2010)
----------------------------------------------

The Bismark output files for single-end and paired-end reads have been
modified so that they contain only vital information, thereby reducing 
their file size and confusion. More details on the output format can be
found at http://seqanswers.com/wiki/Custom_Bismark_output_format or in
the README.txt. 

Both Bismark and the Methylation Extractor now write out their version
info into the first line of their output files so it is easier to track
errors.

Reads aligning to the very edges of chromosomes previously produced
several error messages when trying to extract one additional bp to 
determine if Cs are in CpG context. These reads (which are very few in
in the datasets tested so far) will now be excluded from the methylation
call analysis.



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.1.1 (15 Jun 2010)
----------------------------------------------

Both the Bismark genome preparation as well as Bismark itself should
now also run with genome FASTA files that do not look like Ensembl
files (i.e. chr1.fa,chr.2.fa or similar will be fine, too). For the 
moment it is still required however that the files end on '.fa' and 
only one sequence entry is allowed per file. (Multiple fasta entries 
per file will be supported soon). 



RELEASE NOTES FOR Bismark v0.1 (14 Jun 2010)
--------------------------------------------

Bismark v0.1 is an initial beta release and as such is still a
work in progress.

We have successfully used Bismark for bisulfite mapping against
various genomes (mouse NCBIM37, human NCBI36 and GRCh37, and Yeast 
SGD1.01). In our tests the code appears to be working as expected.

We have initially designed Bismark to support the kinds of analyses
we require, thus if you have some ideas or suggestions which could
be implemented please let us know.
